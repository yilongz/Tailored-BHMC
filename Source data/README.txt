# Global Energy Minimum Configurations
1. The global energy minimum configurations of binary NPs are given in xyz format in each folder
2. Note that periodic boundary conditions were applied to xy dimensions. To properly visualize the configurations, you need to use correct NP sizes, box dimensions, and boundary conditions, which are given in each xyz file
