# Global Energy Minimum Configurations

1. The global energy minimum configurations of binary NPs determined using the BHMC algorithm are given in xyz format in each folder. The configurations correspond to the structures presented in Figures 2B-E, 4A-E, and 5A-D of the manuscript (Zhou & Arya, submitted)

2. Note that periodic boundary conditions were applied to the x and y dimensions. To properly visualize each configuration, e.g., in software such as Ovito, the correct NP sizes, box dimensions, and boundary conditions provided within each xyz file need to be used.

3. Also provided is representative output of energies and configurations obtained during optimization of one of the binary 6:6 system of NPs
